# Friend-Finder

## About
Friend Finder is an app which matches a user with a potential friend profile based on answers to a 10 question survey. The user's name, photo url, and survey answers are stored in a mySQL database, then those answers are compared to those of other profiles in the database, and the one with the most similar answers is displayed.

All users' inputs can be viewed in JSON format by clicking the API Friends List button at the bottom of the page.
